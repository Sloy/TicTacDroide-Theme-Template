	3.d-This template is preconfigured to NOT show on the application drawer so users don't get bloated with theme icons on their app drawers.

4.-Edit the res/values/theme_config.xml to your needs.

5.-Edit the different drawables in there.
	5.a-You can create diferent images for diferent states, or replace the drawables xml with an static image.
	5.b-All the drawables that you don't modify should be deleted so the theme will weight less.

6.-To use a custom font on your theme, put the TTF file in assets/themefont.ttf.
    6.a-Make sure the font is working, some BIG (in filesize) fonts or bad encoded fonts can cause problems.
